# Solid Motion

`@totallynotdavid/solid-motion` is an animation package for Solid 2. It is built
directly on [`motion-dom`](https://motion.dev), the framework-agnostic core of
Motion. Solid's reactive graph drives animation state, and the package starts
per-value `motion-dom` animations directly.

It covers `initial`/`animate`/`exit` targets, variants and stagger, hover,
press, focus and in-view gestures, presence (exit animations), layout and shared
layout animations, scroll-linked values, SVG, and reduced-motion handling.

## Install

```sh
npm install @totallynotdavid/solid-motion solid-js @solidjs/web
```

`solid-js` and `@solidjs/web` are peer dependencies, both `^2.0.0-rc.9`. Solid 2
is still a prerelease, so install the `next` tag until it is stable:
`npm install solid-js@next @solidjs/web@next`.

## Setup

The package ships its TSX source, not compiled JavaScript, and exposes it under
the `solid` export condition. Your build must compile Solid JSX for
dependencies, which `@solidjs/vite-plugin` does:

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import solid from "@solidjs/vite-plugin";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";

export default defineConfig({ plugins: [solid()] });
```

Type declarations are emitted to `dist/` when the package is packed. With
`"jsx": "preserve"` and `"jsxImportSource": "@solidjs/web"` in your
`tsconfig.json`, no other TypeScript setup is needed.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { render } from "@solidjs/web";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";
import { motion } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

function App() {
  const [open, setOpen] = createSignal(true);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen((value) => !value)}>Toggle</button>
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
        animate={{ opacity: open() ? 1 : 0.2, y: 0 }}
        transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}
      >
        Fades and slides in on mount
      </motion.div>
    </>
  );
}

render(() => <App />, document.getElementById("root")!);
```

## `motion.*`

`motion` is a proxy. Accessing `motion.div`, `motion.button`, `motion.line`, or
any other intrinsic tag lazily creates an animated version of that element.
Every non-motion prop (`class`, `onClick`, `children`, …) passes straight
through. `motion.create(Component)` wraps a custom component similarly.

```tsx
import type { JSX } from "@solidjs/web";

const Card = (props: {
  title: string;
  style?: JSX.CSSProperties;
  ref?: JSX.Ref<HTMLDivElement>;
}) => (
  <div ref={props.ref} style={props.style}>
    {props.title}
  </div>
);
const MotionCard = motion.create(Card);
```

The wrapper hands the wrapped component `style` and `ref` the same way it hands
an intrinsic tag its own (see [`createMotion`](#createmotion) below). Motion
mounts on the element only through `ref`, so a component that drops it never
animates at all. `style` isn't involved in mounting; a component that forwards
`ref` but drops `style` still animates, so it just flashes the wrong value on
first paint since there's no server-rendered/first-paint style to match against.
`initial={false}` is the exception: the element is born already at its `animate`
target, so the first pass sees nothing to move and never writes to the node.
Dropping `style` there leaves the element at its browser-default value until a
later prop change gives the pass something to correct. Both `ref` and `style`
should be forwarded to the node that should animate.

Rendering `motion.line`, `motion.path`, or another tag on this package's fixed
SVG list animates SVG geometry correctly. See [SVG animation](#svg-animation)
below for that list. The element receives its initial style, or SVG attributes,
inline during server rendering and the client's first paint. Nothing is applied
after mount, so hydration does not flash.

The component form adds a component boundary and a runtime prop spread. For a
leaf animation under a long list, [`createMotion`](#createmotion) skips both.

## Animation props

These are `MotionOptions`, accepted by both `motion.*` and `createMotion`.
Animation props are read from a thunk, so values resolved from signals are
re-diffed. The `initial` target is the exception: it is resolved once because it
describes the first paint.

- `initial`: The target the element starts at. `initial={false}` (or a `false`
  from an enclosing `AnimatePresence`) skips the entrance animation for a
  subtree that was already on screen.
- `animate`: The target while the element is present. This is the only layer
  that is always active.
- `exit`: The target while a `hold`-based presence boundary animates the element
  out. See [Presence](#presence-animatepresence--animatepresencelist). `exit`
  sits above `animate`, rather than replacing it. A key owned by `animate` but
  omitted from `exit` keeps its animated value while leaving. A key named only
  in `exit` uses its own `transition`, if declared.
- `whileHover` / `whilePress` / `whileFocus` / `whileInView`: See
  [Gestures](#gestures).
- `custom`: Arbitrary data handed to a variant function. If absent, it falls
  back to the nearest ancestor's `custom`, then to the enclosing presence
  boundary's value. This lets a list item drive its own per-row variant from a
  value set at the top.
- `variants`: A `VariantMap`, so any of the layers above can be a string label
  instead of an inline target. See
  [Variants, stagger and orchestration](#variants-stagger-and-orchestration).
- `transition`: A `Transition` (re-exported from `motion-dom`) applied to
  whichever layer is active. Falls back to `MotionConfig`'s `transition` when
  omitted.
- `style`: Plain CSS, except entries may be a `MotionValue` or a Solid accessor.
  Motion-owned keys are written on the animation frame instead of through
  Solid's DOM diffing. Naming the same key in `animate` or another target
  animates an explicit, caller-owned `MotionValue` in place, so it can be read
  back once a pass has actually changed it. `initial` does not do this: it only
  seeds the first paint's inline style and never writes the bound value itself.
  A plain accessor has no caller-owned value to read back at all; it drives a
  private `MotionValue` this package creates and keeps to itself.
- `onAnimationStart(definition)` / `onAnimationComplete(definition)` /
  `onUpdate(latest)`: Plain callbacks, not reactive.

A target may also be a list of variant labels
(`animate={["hidden", "visible"]}`), resolved against `variants` and merged left
to right, with later entries winning per key. Inline targets cannot be mixed
into that array; `AnimationDefinition` only accepts `string[]` alongside a
single label, a single inline target, or `false`. A value inside an inline
target can itself be a keyframe array (`animate={{ opacity: [0, 1] }}`). For
`height`, `width`, and other pairs with incompatible start and end units (`0` to
`"auto"`, `"none"`, or `"100%"`), the package measures the element and animates
between the resulting numbers. This measurement path applies to HTML elements
only. SVG uses its attribute path instead.

## `createMotion`

```tsx
import { createMotion } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

function CollapsibleRow(props: { open: boolean }) {
  const motionHandle = createMotion(() => ({
    animate: { height: props.open ? "auto" : 0 },
    transition: { duration: 0.2 },
  }));

  return <div class="row" style={motionHandle.style} ref={motionHandle.ref} />;
}
```

`createMotion(options, tag?)` is the primitive behind `motion.div`. It contains
the whole engine without a component boundary. It takes a thunk of
`MotionOptions` and an optional tag name. The tag only decides whether the
initial paint uses style or SVG attributes. It returns a `MotionHandle`:

- `style`: The inline style the element must be born with. Merge it over any
  style of your own. The motion target must win the first paint.
- `attrs`: The same, for SVG geometry attributes. Empty for HTML.
- `ref`: Attach it to the element. It runs the animation lifecycle and registers
  variant children for stagger.
- `scope`: What this element offers descendants when it names a variant label,
  or `null`. It exists so `motion.div` can provide it through context for its
  own children; the scope type itself is internal and not exported, so a leaf
  animation never needs it and a custom wrapper cannot plug into it directly.

Use `createMotion` instead of `motion.div` when an element sits under a long,
frequently updating list. The primitive keeps `class`, `onClick`, and every
other attribute on Solid's compiled setters instead of a runtime spread.

## `createMotionValue`

```tsx
import { createMotionValue, motion } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

function Ball() {
  const [targetX, setTargetX] = createSignal(0);

  // Follows the source immediately.
  const scale = createMotionValue(1);

  // Springs toward source changes.
  const x = createMotionValue(targetX, { stiffness: 300, damping: 30 });

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setTargetX((value) => value + 100)}>Move</button>
      <motion.div style={{ x, scale }} />
    </>
  );
}
```

`createMotionValue(source, transition?)` creates a `MotionValue` that lives
outside Solid's render path: writes land straight on the element on the
animation frame, so nothing re-renders when it moves. `source` can be a
constant, a Solid accessor, or another `MotionValue`. With a `transition`,
source changes retarget a spring from its current position and velocity instead
of restarting it. The value is destroyed automatically when its owning scope is
cleaned up.

Bind it to an element through `style`, and it stays reactive there like any
other bound style entry (see `style` above). Solid does not need `useTransform`
or `useMotionTemplate`: a derived value is just an accessor. Use the re-exported
[`transform`](#re-exported-helpers-stagger-transform) for range mapping, as in
`style={{ opacity: () => fade(scroll()) }}`. Use a template literal for the
template form.

## Gestures

`whileHover`, `whilePress`, and `whileFocus` each define a target that applies
only while that state is active. Drag (`drag`, `dragControls`) is not
implemented.

```tsx
<motion.button
  initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.05 }}
  whilePress={{ scale: 0.95 }}
  whileFocus={{ outline: "2px solid var(--accent)" }}
/>
```

Hover and press use `motion-dom`'s gesture recognizers rather than hand-written
`pointerenter`/`pointerdown` listeners. Hover filters polyfilled touch events
and defers its end while a press is in flight, so a button does not flicker when
the pointer slips off mid-click. Press filters secondary and multi-touch
pointers, ends during the capture phase, and also fires from Enter on a
keyboard. `whileFocus` gates on `:focus-visible`, so a mouse click does not
trigger a focus style. A missing prop attaches no listener. An element without
`whileHover` pays nothing for hover handling.

`whileInView` applies while the element is in the viewport, tuned by a sibling
`viewport` prop:

```tsx
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 40 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.5 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
/>
```

`viewport: { once, root, margin, amount }`: `once` unobserves after the element
has entered, rather than re-checking a flag. `root` and `margin` map to
`IntersectionObserver`'s `root` and `rootMargin`. `amount` is `"some"` (any part
visible), `"all"`, or a 0–1 threshold.

`createInView(element, viewport?)` exposes the same observer as a plain boolean
accessor, with no animation attached. It is useful for an infinite-scroll
sentinel, a lazily mounted chart, or an impression tracker that has nothing to
do with motion:

```tsx
import { createInView } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";
import { createSignal } from "solid-js";

function LazyChart() {
  const [node, setNode] = createSignal<HTMLElement>();
  const inView = createInView(node, { once: true });

  return <div ref={setNode}>{inView() ? <Chart /> : null}</div>;
}
```

Like every other primitive here, it needs a reactive owner: called from a
component body or an effect, not from module scope. Called without one, the
observer is still created and starts observing, but its disconnect on cleanup
has nowhere to register, so it leaks for the page's lifetime instead of being
torn down.

## Presence: `AnimatePresence` / `AnimatePresenceList`

Both keep a subtree mounted while its `exit` animation plays and unmount it once
every animated element inside has released its hold. A hold is used instead of a
promise because a cancelled `motion-dom` animation's `finished` promise never
settles.

This does not reach through a nested presence boundary. A nested
`AnimatePresence` or `AnimatePresenceList` provides its own presence scope,
which shadows the outer one for everything inside it, so any exit hold taken
there registers with the inner boundary instead of the outer one. If the outer
subtree exits while that nested boundary is still finishing its own exit, the
outer boundary sees zero holds and unmounts the whole nested subtree during its
own cleanup, cutting the nested exit short. Keep an `AnimatePresence` at the
boundary that actually needs to wait, rather than nesting one inside a subtree
another boundary can also remove.

`AnimatePresence` is the single/keyed form. Control it with a `when` value
rather than a conditional child. Solid disposes a branch as soon as its
condition flips, before a boundary can notice it. The boundary must build and
own the subtree itself so it can hold the outgoing element:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

<AnimatePresence when={selectedId()}>
  {(id) => (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    >
      {id}
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresence>;
```

`when` doubles as the identity key: falsy renders nothing, and changing it to a
different truthy value swaps, with the outgoing and incoming subtrees animating
at the same time by default (`mode="wait"` holds the newcomer back until the
outgoing one is fully gone). Returning to a key still mid-exit revives that
subtree instead of building a second one beside it.

`AnimatePresenceList` is the keyed-list form:

```tsx
import { AnimatePresenceList, motion } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

<AnimatePresenceList each={items()} getKey={(item) => item.id}>
  {(item) => (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    >
      {item().label}
    </motion.div>
  )}
</AnimatePresenceList>;
```

The child function receives an accessor, not the raw item. Use `item()` inside
it so a surviving row picks up new data without being recreated. A row removed
from `each` stays mounted at its old position, rather than collapsing to the end
of the list, until its exit animation finishes. Both components accept
`initial={false}`, `custom` (handed down as each element's inherited `custom`),
and `onExitComplete`. `initial={false}` is a property of the boundary, not of
one render: it skips the entrance animation for every element the boundary ever
renders, including a row added long after the boundary itself first mounted, not
only the ones present at that first render.

`usePresence()` returns the enclosing boundary's presence context, or `null`
outside one. `createMotion` uses it to resolve the `exit` layer and animation
holds. Most consumers never need it directly.

## `MotionConfig` / `useMotionConfig`

```tsx
import { MotionConfig } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user" transition={{ duration: 0.2 }}>
  <App />
</MotionConfig>;
```

Sets shared defaults for descendants. Nested providers merge their values over
inherited configuration:

- `transition`: The fallback `Transition` for any element that names none of its
  own.
- `skipAnimations`: A hard off switch. Every animation started under it jumps
  straight to its target. This applies at the point where every animation is
  created, so it also overrides a target's own `transition`.
- `reducedMotion`: `"never"` (default), `"always"`, or `"user"` (follows the OS
  preference via `useReducedMotion`). This does not disable every animation:
  positional and layout keys jump while opacity and colour still animate,
  matching Motion's reduced-motion contract.

## `useReducedMotion`

```tsx
import { useReducedMotion } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();
```

A Solid accessor for `(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`. A single `matchMedia`
listener is installed at module load, not per element. Read it directly only for
your own conditional logic. `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` already wires it
into every motion element's animations.

## Variants, stagger, and orchestration

A `variants` map lets `initial`/`animate`/`exit`/the gesture props take a string
label instead of an inline target, optionally as a function of `custom`:

```tsx
import { motion, type VariantMap } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

const variants: VariantMap = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: (custom) => ({
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { delay: (custom as number) * 0.05 },
  }),
};

<motion.div
  variants={variants}
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  custom={2}
/>;
```

`motion.*` types every variant function's parameter as `unknown`, not the
`custom` type a particular instance passes, so a cast is unavoidable there.
`createMotion<TCustom>` (the primitive behind it) does carry a real generic:
call it directly when you want the compiler to check `custom` end to end.

An element whose layer names a label becomes a variant-controlling scope. Its
resolved label propagates to descendants through context, so a child with a
matching `variants` map inherits it without repeating the prop. An inline target
is never inherited. It does not resolve against a child's different `variants`
map, and a child's own prop always wins over inherited state.

Stagger is offered through `transition` on the controlling parent:

```tsx
<motion.div
  variants={variants}
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  transition={{ staggerChildren: 0.1, staggerDirection: 1 }}
>
  <motion.div variants={variants} />
  <motion.div variants={variants} />
</motion.div>
```

`delayChildren` is the base offset every child gets. `staggerChildren` adds a
per-position increment, and `staggerDirection: -1` reverses which end starts
first. Position is read live from the DOM, so a keyed list reordering rows
staggers correctly without re-registering them.

For non-constant stagger, `delayChildren` also accepts the `stagger()` function
provided by `motion-dom`. It is re-exported from this package, so consumers do
not need to import `motion-dom` directly. A function replaces the constant form
instead of adding to it:

```tsx
import { motion, stagger } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

<motion.div
  variants={variants}
  initial="hidden"
  animate="visible"
  transition={{ delayChildren: stagger(0.1) }}
>
  <motion.div variants={variants} />
  <motion.div variants={variants} />
</motion.div>;
```

`transition.when` sequences a controlling element's pass with its children's:

```tsx
transition={{ duration: 0.2, when: "beforeChildren" }}
```

`"beforeChildren"` holds every descendant's pass until the parent's own pass
finishes. `"afterChildren"` holds the parent back until every descendant's pass
finishes. Sequencing composes with presence, so a `beforeChildren`-sequenced
exit stays inside its `AnimatePresence` hold until it starts.

## SVG animation

`motion.line`, `motion.path`, `motion.circle`, and the rest of the fixed tag
list this package recognizes as SVG (`animate`, `circle`, `defs`, `desc`,
`ellipse`, `filter`, `g`, `image`, `line`, `marker`, `mask`, `metadata`, `path`,
`pattern`, `polygon`, `polyline`, `rect`, `stop`, `svg`, `switch`, `symbol`,
`text`, `tspan`, `use`, `view`) render in the SVG namespace. Geometry that CSS
cannot animate (`x1`, `x2`, `r`, `viewBox`, …) is written and animated as
attributes on those tags, never as style. A tag missing from that list —
`foreignObject`, `clipPath`, and `linearGradient` among them — is not recognized
as SVG by this package, so its initial geometry is emitted as `style` instead of
attributes, even where the tag itself is genuinely SVG:

```tsx
<svg viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <motion.line
    initial={{ x1: 0, x2: 0 }}
    animate={{ x2: 100 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
  />
</svg>
```

`pathLength` animates a path drawing itself by driving the `stroke-dasharray`
pair behind the scenes:

```tsx
<motion.path
  d="M0 0 L100 100"
  initial={{ pathLength: 0 }}
  animate={{ pathLength: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
/>
```

`opacity`, `transform`, `fill`, and other CSS-animatable properties still go
through `style` on an SVG element, as they do on HTML. A custom component
(`motion.create(MyComponent)`) is always assumed to render HTML. Only a literal
SVG tag name is known before the element exists.

## Re-exported helpers: `stagger`, `transform`

Both functions are re-exported from `motion-dom`, so consumers of this package's
orchestration or value APIs do not need a direct `motion-dom` dependency:

- `stagger(duration, options?)`: Builds the per-child delay function
  `delayChildren` takes. See [stagger](#variants-stagger-and-orchestration)
  above.
- `transform(inputRange, outputRange, options?)`: The pure range-mapping
  interpolator behind Motion's `useTransform`. In Solid, a derived value is just
  an accessor over it, not a second value kept in sync by a subscription:

  ```tsx
  import { motion, transform } from "@totallynotdavid/solid-motion";

  const fade = transform([0, 200], [0, 1]);
  <motion.div style={{ opacity: () => fade(scrollY()) }} />;
  ```

## Layout, scroll values, and imperative primitives

`layout` and `layoutId` are `MotionOptions` props: `layout` animates an element
across a change in its own measured box, and two elements sharing a `layoutId`
animate as one shared element across a change in which of them is mounted.
Neither needs `VisualElement`; the projection engine behind them is generic over
the host element instead.

`createScroll`, `createVelocity`, and `createTime` are scroll-linked values, for
a `style` entry driven by scroll position rather than a discrete state change:
`createScroll(options?)` tracks a container/target pair (or the page, by
default) and returns four `MotionValue`s (`scrollX`, `scrollY`,
`scrollXProgress`, `scrollYProgress`) as raw pixel offsets and normalized 0-1
progress, `createVelocity(source)` derives another `MotionValue`'s rate of
change, decaying to zero once its source goes stale rather than freezing at the
last reading, and `createTime()` is the animation frame loop's own clock.

`createAnimate` and `createWillChange` are the imperative primitives for an
element this package does not render itself, such as a chart library's own
nodes. `createAnimate` returns `[scope, animate]`: `scope` is a callback-plus-
signal ref, matching this package's own ref convention rather than motion-dom's
`AnimationScope`, and `animate` targets the scope's own element, a descendant,
an explicit element or array, or a sequence of `[target, definition]` steps
played one after another. `createWillChange` builds a shared `will-change` value
that several independent animations can each add a hint to.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run check
```

`check` runs the type check, lint, format check, tests (vitest on jsdom, with a
fake animation clock) and the declaration build. `bun run format` fixes
formatting.
