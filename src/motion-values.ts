 * all because React has no way to observe a plain variable; here the signal
 * already is the source, and this only carries it across to the frame loop.
 *
 * With a `transition` the value does not jump to its source, it animates there,
 * springing by default. That is Motion's `useSpring`: `stiffness` and `damping`
 * describe the physics, and every change to the source retargets the spring
 * from its current position and velocity rather than restarting it.
 *
 * Destroyed with the scope that created it, so a component unmounting takes its
 * subscriptions with it.
